Bingo Bash is a Hat in Time Mod that aims to change the games balance to for a better Bingo experience.

 It aims to make later content accessible quicker than normal.



This mod implements the following changes:


- Unlock The Arctic Cruise after fewer Time Pieces (30 by default, can be configured)


- Unlock Deathwish after just finishing Your Contract has Expired


- Disables the stamp requirements for deathwishes


- Disables the requirement to clear the original level first before attempting a deathwish variant (can be configured)



Not enabled by default but configurable:


- Disable progression of deathwishes (all deathwishes are unlocked directly, no need to clear parent deathwishes first)
